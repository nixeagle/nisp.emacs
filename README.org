#+TITLE: nisp.emacs

This is a combination of my .emacs and useful libraries intended for
others. Right now there really is no clear distinction and there won't
be for a few days. I hope to release v0.1 in a few days.

I have rougly 3,000 lines of emacs lisp that is right now very
unorganized but some of it implements new functionality others might
like to try. Those libraries will aspire to meet most GNU emacs coding
conventions and will be listed below at the release of v0.1. However
please note that internal variables (defvar, not (defcustom, tend to be
annotated in the common lisp style. eg =*foo*= instead of =foo=. As
these are internal variables and are not intended to be user visible I
have no qualms with breaking this particular style convention. The vast
majority of the others I know about however are followed.

Finally please note that anything under github-forks is a fork of an
existing project that I forked for the intent of using git submodules
and carrying on my own development and integration of patches/forks from
other github forks.

Please send bug reports to i@nixeagle.org labeled clearly as such.
