******* Rename nisp-paste-remote-host to -remote-directory          :paste:
        :PROPERTIES:
        :VERSION:  0.2.0
        :END:
        not going to work, release v0.2.0 _INCOMPATABLE CHANGE_.
          
        Please enter M-x customize-group RET nisp-paste RET and set the path
        again. The variable is renamed and I do not know how to tell
        customize to depreciate things.
          
        Because this is not after the 1.0 release minor version number
        increases signal feature additions _and_ incompatable
        changes. Please read the commit summaries for v0.X.0 releases.
